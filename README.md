# random-fox-img
Silly little fox image generator! Uses xinitrc's random fox generator API from their [randomfox website](https://randomfox.ca/).
I'm unsure of why but it can only work correctly from the (linux) terminal. Haven't tested it fully but it probably doesn't require sudo
At the moment the program writes a file named "fox.jpg" into where you put it, will figure out how to change that.
