# random-fox-img
Silly little fox image generator! Uses xinitrc's random fox generator API from their [randomfox website](https://randomfox.ca/). <br>
I'm unsure of why but if you're on linux, run it from the terminal (Doesn't require sudo), it wont work otherwise.<br> P.D. I haven't tested it on windows.
